# Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks

Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks (or SSPB for short) reintroduces vanilla-like smooth lighting to all non-fluid blocks with inset faces (e.g. dirt paths and how they have dark shading when directly next to a full block) when using Sodium, as Sodium removes this (or rather, fixes this, as it's technically a bug).

The strength of this shading is also adjustable (except for path blocks when "Use vanilla lighting for path blocks" is on).

Unless "Use vanilla lighting for path blocks" is enabled, this lighting will not be exactly the same as vanilla, only vanilla-like, as the way I'm doing this is entirely based on Sodium's smooth lighting code.

Requires [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric). If using the "Use vanilla lighting for path blocks" option on a version before 4.x.x, also requires [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium) and [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) (or [Quilted Fabric API](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilted-fabric-api) if using Quilt).
